							Ridi Privacy Policy
						</h1>
						<p>(updated on 19 February 2019)</p>
						<p>This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how Ridi Holdings Inc. and its
								respective subsidiaries, associate companies and jointly controlled entities
								(“Ridi Group”) use your Personal Data.</p>
						<p><b>Collection of Personal Data</b></p>
						<p>“Personal Data” means information about you, from which you are identifiable,
								including but not limited to your name, nationality, address, telephone number,
								fax number, bank details, credit card details, gender, resident status, financial
								background, personal interests, email address, your occupation, your photo,
								any information about you which you have provided to Ridi Group in
								registration forms, application forms or any other similar forms and/or any
								information about you that has been or may be collected, stored, used and/or
								processed by Ridi Group from time to time and includes sensitive personal
								data such as your identification card number, driving licence number, birth
								certificate number, passport number, race, ethnic origin, date of birth, marital
								status, education background, and data relating to health, religious or other
								similar beliefs. If you are a service provider, we may also collect telematics
								data (such as your speed, acceleration, and braking data), device data (such
								as your IMEI number and the names of the apps you have installed on your
								device) and your vehicle registration data.</p>
						<p>The provision of your Personal Data is voluntary. However, if you do not
								provide Ridi Group your Personal Data, Ridi Group will not be able to process
								your Personal Data for the Purposes and Additional Purposes outlined below
								and may cause Ridi Group to be unable to provide services or products to or
								accept payments from you.</p>
						<p>If you are an agent, vendor, supplier or service provider, provision of your
								Personal Data is mandatory and failure to provide your Personal Data, may be
								a breach of laws or regulatory requirements, and may cause Ridi Group to be
								unable to engage you to provide services or products or issue payments to
								you for products or services provided.</p>
						<p>In addition to the Personal Data you provide to Ridi Group directly, Ridi Group
								may collect your Personal Data from publicly available sources or from third
								parties, for example:</p>
								<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
									<li>From filled up application or registration forms, surveys or training tools
											or other similar forms;</li>
									<li>From publicly available sources such as directories;</li>
									<li>From Ridi Group’s official social media pages, if you follow, like or are a
											fan of such pages;</li>
									<li>From credit reporting agencies, insurance providers, or financial services
											providers;</li>
									<li>When you interact and communicate with Ridi Group at any events or
											activities;</li>
									<li>When you enter contests organized by Ridi Group;</li>
									<li>From various entities or divisions under Ridi Group;</li>

								device data and data collected when your Ridi Driver app is on.
								Further, certain service providers of Ridi Group may utilise personal in-vehicle
								cameras for their own safety and security purposes. Whilst the use of such in-
								vehicle cameras are neither endorsed or prohibited by Ridi Group, Ridi Group
								does not collect, use or disclose any of your Personal Data from such in-
								vehicle recordings, and the collection, use and disclosure of any such
								Personal Data is not conducted on behalf of Ridi Group. The collection, use
								and disclosure of Personal Data obtained from personal in-vehicle cameras is
								solely the responsibility of the service provider and you should inform your
								service provider if you have any objections to the use of personal in-vehicle
								cameras in such vehicles.</p>
